# Zypher

## Random ideas

- "Print" specific abilities during specific times, then make them unavailable

  - will build fomo but also reward older players

- on hover of spawns, not just enhance size/zoom, but put a graph to the right displaying base stats, but maybe only after you have identified it once.

  - maybe implement a "scan" ability that will reveal the stats of a spawn going forward. (and vulnerabilities....)

- Spawns are self contained AIs

  - instead of full dialog box they have a "thought bubble" that pops up with a message

- if we get to full AI story telling, every person could be challenged to battle and have a deck dynamic upon what type of person they are and what they have equipped.
