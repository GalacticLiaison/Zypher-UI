## Random ideas

- "Print" specific abilities during specific times, then make them unavailable

  - will build fomo but also reward older players

- on hover of spawns, not just enhance size/zoom, but put a graph to the right displaying base stats, but maybe only after you have identified it once.
  - maybe implement a "scan" ability that will reveal the stats of a spawn going forward.
